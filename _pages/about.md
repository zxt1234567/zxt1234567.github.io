Xintong Zhang
=====

Hi, I’m Xintong. I am an junior student majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Dukekunshan University. I am recently collaborating with [Dr. Junfeng Chen](https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/), [Prof. Meng Guo](https://mengguo.github.io/personal_site/) and his team from Peking University.

My works focus on adaptive coordination and communication in multi-robot systems, particularly under challenging conditions such as intermittent connectivity, limited communication, and unknown environments. I specialize in developing frameworks that optimize task planning, dynamic allocation, and communication strategies for heterogeneous robotic fleets (e.g., UAVs/UGVs) using LLM, optimization, and tree-search algorithms. Through high-fidelity simulations and innovative algorithmic designs, I aim to address practical challenges in dynamic scenarios while ensuring reliable system performance. Currently, I am keenly interested in exploring how learning-based methods and explicit modeling of robot-world interactions can enhance the robustness, adaptability, and practical deployability of autonomous systems.

    <strong>Overview:</strong> We propose a formal method and LLM framework for coordinating large fleets of heterogeneous robots in open and dynamic environments. Our approach integrates model-checking-based task planning with LLM-powered reasoning and interaction, ensuring adaptability, explainability, and optimal mission execution. Validated through simulations and real-world deployments, it proves effective for disaster response, infrastructure inspection, and dynamic surveillance.
