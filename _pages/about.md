Xintong Zhang
=====

Hi, Iâ€™m Xintong. I am an sophomore student majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Dukekunshan University. I am recently collaborating with Prof.Meng Guo and his team from Peking University.

My research interests focus on adaptive coordination and communication in multi-robot systems, particularly under challenging conditions such as intermittent connectivity, limited communication, and unknown environments. I specialize in developing frameworks that optimize task planning, dynamic allocation, and communication strategies for heterogeneous robotic fleets (e.g., UAVs/UGVs) using LLM, optimization, and tree-search algorithms. My work emphasizes creating robust, scalable, and explainable solutions for real-world applications, including large-scale 3D exploration, inspection, and interaction. Through high-fidelity simulations and innovative algorithmic designs, I aim to address practical challenges in dynamic scenarios while ensuring reliable system performance.
